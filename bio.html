<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>My name is Josiah Ingram, and I am a student at Eastern Washington University in the Technical Communications program. I am originally from the west coast of Washington State, and enjoy binging Netflix, eating copious amounts of pizza, and working out in my spare time. Thank you for swinging by and taking a look at my site! If there is anything else you would like to know, or if you have any questions for me, feel free to shoot me an email and I’d be happy to talk to you!</p>

<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>
After completing my education, I hope to work as a technical writer for Microsoft in Seattle, WA. My initial objective is to gain the necessary experience and general know-how to pursue a career as a technical editor.
 <h2>Professional Skillset</h2>
I have full knowledge of and experience utilizing the Microsoft Office suite, and moderate experience with the Adobe Creative Cloud suite. I have excellent written and oral communication skills, and am fully comfortable interacting with/speaking to large groups. For several of my classes I have had to lead seminars or large presentations, and have received very positive feedback. I am very professional, and work well with others. My experience with the military has provided me with a keen sense of deadlines, as well as working under pressure.

<h2>Work &amp; Volunteer Activities</h2>
I have worked a variety of retail jobs in my early years, and have also assisted my family in the running of a bakery. The only relevant work experience related to my field has been acquired from the United States Army National Guard, where I work as a production control/logistics specialist. 
I have volunteered on three separate occasions. In 2005, I participated in a slums outreach opportunity in Brazil with a small team, where I lived for two months and helped in the poor communities in the area. In 2006, I travelled to Thailand, where I taught English at a local college for two months while also participating in a slums outreach. In 2007, I participated in a youth outreach program, working with underprivileged youth and improving a local park.
